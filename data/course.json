  "course_title": "Host Hacking: Parasitic Manipulations from a Micro- to a Macroscopic Scale",
  "course_description": "Parasites require a hospitable organism to reproduce and spread and have evolved multiple strategies to subvert their hosts. Parasites scavenge nutrients directly from host cells, evade the host immune system and even modify host behavior to increase their transmission. This course will explore the strategies used by a ubiquitous and harmful class of parasites to hijack the biology of their host cells. We will discuss pathogens such as _Plasmodium_ and _Toxoplasma,_ responsible for some of the deadliest and most pervasive infectious diseases on the planet.\n\nBy exploring how these pathogens invade a host cell and replicate while evading the immune system, students will gain a broad understanding of basic cell biology, biochemistry and immunology, as well as learn techniques commonly used in cell biology. Students will be challenged to think creatively and flexibly to understand, critique, interpret, and design scientific experiments in the field of host-pathogen interactions.\n",
